- 👋 Hi, I’m @GilbertJin
- 👀 I’m interested in programming in C/C++ and Python, and reinforce learning, especially GAN.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything about GAN. Of course, all the college curricula are also in need of learning.
- 📫 How to reach me? Just leave a message in my website or send me an email.
